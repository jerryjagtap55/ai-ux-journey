# My AI/UX/Data Journey
I'm learning to combine data, design, and machine learning to build smarter digital products.
- 🔧 Tools: Python, SQL, Figma, Streamlit
- 📌 Goal: Create 2 projects by July 2025
- 🚀 Follow along!


2nd day
📌 Task 1: Python Practice:
Variables, data types
Loops & conditionals
Lists, dictionaries, tuples

📌 Task 2: Quick SQL Refresher
Practice:
SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, GROUP BY
Aggregates like COUNT(), AVG(), SUM()
🎯 Goal: Be comfortable reading and writing simple queries by the end of the week.


🎯 Day 3 Focus:

📌 Task 1: Watch + Reflect (AI in UX)
🔗 Watch this video (YouTube/LinkedIn Learning suggestion):
“How AI is Changing UX Design” – covers personalization, predictive UX, and AI-generated interfaces. (Let me know if you want specific links)

💡 Take notes on:
Any tools or companies mentioned
How AI improves or complicates user experience
What you would love to work on in this space

📌 Task 2: Explore AI Tools for Designers (30 mins)
Pick 1–2 from this list and try them out or sign up for demos:

Uizard – AI wireframe to prototype
Galileo AI – prompt-based UI generation
Magician for Figma – AI assistant plugin
ChatGPT + Figma/Notion workflows
⚡️Goal: See what AI in design looks like in action.

📌 Task 3: Project Idea Brainstorm (UX + Data + AI)
Pick one of these starter project ideas:
"Smart Feedback Dashboard" – Design a dashboard using AI to categorize user feedback (use your Python script from Day 2!)
"AI-Powered Habit App" – A UX case study for a habit tracker that adapts based on user behavior
"Redesign ChatGPT UI for Non-Tech Users" – Emphasize accessibility, clarity, onboarding


🛠 Start sketching or outlining:
Problem
Target user
Why AI or data makes this better
Tools you'll use (Python, Figma, GPT, etc.)
✅ This will become one of your signature portfolio projects — let me know which one you pick and I’ll help you flesh it out.
